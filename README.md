## 5. Features / Highlights

### • Business Problem
Customer churn significantly impacts recurring revenue and profitability. Companies need a predictive system to flag customers at risk of leaving.

### • Goal of the Project
- Build a machine learning model to predict customer churn with high accuracy.  
- Help businesses develop **data-driven retention strategies**.  

### • Walkthrough of Key Steps
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualized churn distribution, correlation heatmaps, and feature importance.  
- **Modeling**: Tested multiple algorithms (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.).  
- **Evaluation**: Compared models using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC.  
- **Insights**: Identified top churn drivers such as tenure, contract type, and monthly charges.  

### • Business Impact & Insights
- **Retention Focus**: Pinpointed high-risk customer groups for targeted retention campaigns.  
- **Revenue Protection**: Improved ability to forecast churn and reduce customer acquisition costs.  
- **Strategic Planning**: Provides actionable insights into churn drivers for long-term policy adjustments.
